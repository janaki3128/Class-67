once there lived a rabbit and a tortoise in a forest. the tortoise was very lazier than the rabbit. the rabbit used to be very proud about that. one day the rabbit thought to do a race with the tortoise because he was lazy.so, that afternoon the rabbit went searching the tortoise to ask him about the race.
